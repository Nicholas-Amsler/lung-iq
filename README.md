## üìà Evidence Base

This simulator incorporates current evidence-based guidelines from leading medical organizations:

### üè• **Adult Ventilation Standards**
- **ARDSnet Protocols**: Low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/kg IBW) - **rigorously implemented**
- **Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Calculations**: Height and gender-based using ARDSnet formula for all adults ‚â•18 years
- **2024 ATS Clinical Practice Guidelines**: Updated ARDS management recommendations
- **Lung-Protective Ventilation**: Driving pressure <15 cmH‚ÇÇO, plateau pressure <30 cmH‚ÇÇO

### üë∂ **Pediatric & Neonatal Standards**
- **American Academy of Pediatrics**: Neonatal ventilation guidelines (2023-2024)
- **AARC Clinical Practice Guidelines**: Pediatric mechanical ventilation standards
- **Pediatric Tidal Volumes**: 4-6 mL/kg **actual body weight** (NOT IBW) for children <18 years

### üî¨ **2024 Literature-Based Physiological Values**
- **Compliance values**: ARDS (35-45 mL/cmH‚ÇÇO), COPD (59-66 mL/cmH‚ÇÇO), Normal (50-80 mL/cmH‚ÇÇO)
- **Resistance values**: ARDS (10-15 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s), COPD (10-25 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s), Normal (4-10 cmH‚ÇÇO/L/s)
- **Time constants**: ARDS (0.46s [0.40-0.55]), COPD (1.07s [0.68-2.14]), Normal (0.60s [0.51-0.71])
- **Driving pressure limit**: <15 cmH‚ÇÇO to prevent VILI
- **Inverse ratio ventilation**: Used for oxygenation in severe ARDS, not for expiratory assistance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Safety Distinction**
- **Adults**: Use **IBW** (calculated from height + gender) to prevent volutrauma in obese patients
- **Pediatrics**: Use **actual body weight** as lung development scales with overall growth
- **Clinical Impact**: Using actual weight instead of IBW in adults can cause 15-40% overdose leading to VILI

#### üìã Clinical Impact Assessment
| Patient Profile | Risk Without IBW | Safe with IBW | Improvement |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Obese Female (165cm, 75kg) | 450 mL (unsafe) | 341 mL (safe) | -24% volutrauma prevention |
| Large Male (182cm, 90kg) | 540 mL (dangerous) | 461 mL (safe) | -15% VILI prevention |
| Elderly Female (158cm, 80kg) | 480 mL (unsafe) | 304 mL (safe) | -37% lung protection |

#### üîç Documentation and Guidelines
- **Clinical Guidelines Created**: `IBW_CLINICAL_GUIDELINES.md` - comprehensive decision trees
- **Validation Reports**: Complete technical validation of all IBW calculations
- **Safety Protocols**: Clear distinction between adult (IBW) and pediatric (actual weight) usage
